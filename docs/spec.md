# Specification Overview

This is the technical specification, for developers who want to create components that work within a Composable Form. You should not try to do this until you've first read and understood the [user documentation](user.md).

Depending on which type of component you want to create, read the related spec:

- [Form](spec/form.md)
- [FormList](spec/list.md)
- [Field](spec/field.md)
- [ErrorBlock](spec/errors.md)
- [Input](spec/input.md)
- [validator](spec/validation.md)
