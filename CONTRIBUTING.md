# Contributing

Edit only the files in /docs and mkdocs.yml and the readme. Do not edit anything in /site or it will be lost on the next build.

## Theme

The `cinder` folder contains the theme, which is from https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder but updated for newer mkdocs and tweaked a bit. You may make minimal changes in this folder if necessary.
